# install

Collection of installation scripts to install various CLI tools
that is either completely missing, or old in the default installation package tree.

Should support Fedora and Ubuntu in those cases where a proper package
repository exists, otherwise just install the naked CLI tools.

Must support installation as root, and optionally as a user local installation.
